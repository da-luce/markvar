# Markvar

## Introduction

Markvar seamlessly integrates script-generated data into Markdown documents.
It's designed to automate the process of updating Markdown files with new
information generated by scripts, streamlining the workflow for creating dynamic,
data-rich reports.

## Features

* **Automated Data Insertion**: Automatically updates Markdown documents with
  fresh data from scripts.
* **No plugins necessary**: Utilizes HTML comments as placeholders in Markdown
  for easy data mapping.
* **Customizable**: Flexible to adapt to different Markdown structures and
  outputs.
* **Efficient Workflow**: Reduces manual copy-pasting, saving time and reducing
   errors.

## Future Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Go (1.15 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Markvar.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd Markvar
   ```

3. Build the application using Go:

   ```bash
   go build
   ```

### Usage

Prepare your Markdown file with ID-based placeholders for data insertion:

```markdown
<!--id:summary--><!---->
<!--id:data1--><!---->
```

Run your script to generate the JSON data file (see [example](example/mappings.json)).
Execute the Markvar program with the paths to your Markdown and JSON files:

```bash
./Markvar -md path/to/your/markdown.md -json path/to/your/data.json
```

The Markdown file will be automatically updated with the new data.
